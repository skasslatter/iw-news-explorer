# Interfacewer News Explorer Test

Hello! Welcome to our Angular development test. This test has been created in order to assess your level.
In the next 4h, you will develop a small application.

## Setup

* If you use Docker: `docker-compose up`
* If you don't: `npm install && npm start`

This should install all the needed packages and start a local server.

## Dependencies and APIs

* Angular 5 with the Angular CLI
* We have pre-installed for you 3 packages: font-awesome, bootstrap (CSS only) and primeng
* Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything for reference on how to get news and https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources on how to get sources

## Test

We want to build a news explorer that gets news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

* The user must be able to filter news by:
  * a global search
  * a list of sources
* As soon as the user changes the fitlers, the news must be updated.
* She also must be able to save filters and watch the news associated with them later.
* She can see the saved filters in the navigation bar.
* The app must look like `docs/sketch.jpg`

We recommend that you focus on the functionality first. If you have time left, you can of course style the app.
